## Introduction
When learning Apache Spark, one of the main sources of confusion comes from the terms **Spark Architecture** and **Spark Application Architecture**.  
Though they sound similar, they describe different aspects of Spark.  
This document clarifies both and highlights the differences.

---

## Spark Architecture (Macro-Level / System Level)
- Refers to the **overall design of Spark as a framework**.
- Describes **how Spark works internally**, including:
  - Driver
  - Executors
  - Cluster Manager
  - DAG Scheduler
  - Task Scheduler
- Focuses on **Spark’s execution engine and components**.

---

## Spark Application Architecture (Micro-Level / Program Level)
- Refers to the **architecture of a specific Spark job/application** submitted by the user.
- Describes **how Spark executes that application**:
  - User writes Spark code → Driver program creates a Logical and Physical Plan.
  - Cluster Manager assigns Executors.
  - Executors run tasks in parallel.
  - Results are sent back to the Driver.
- Focuses on the **lifecycle of a Spark job**.

---

### Execution Flow
1. You write code → `SparkSession` connects to **Cluster Manager**.  
2. Cluster Manager assigns **executors only for your app**.  
3. **Driver** creates DAG → submits tasks → executors run them.  
4. Results are returned to the **driver**.

## Key Differences

| Aspect                     | Spark Architecture                               | Spark Application Architecture                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | Overall design of Spark as a framework          | Design of how a specific Spark job is executed      |
| **Scope**                   | Framework-level (system design)                 | Application-level (job execution)                   |
| **Components**              | Driver, Executors, Cluster Manager, DAG Scheduler, Task Scheduler | Driver, Executors, Cluster Manager (specific to one job) |
| **Focus**                   | Internal working of Spark                       | Lifecycle of a Spark job/application                |
| **Example**                 | Explaining DAG Scheduler, Task execution model  | Submitting a PySpark job and seeing how it executes |

## Conclusion
- **Spark Architecture** → The big picture: how Spark as a system works internally.  
- **Spark Application Architecture** → The execution lifecycle of a single Spark job.
